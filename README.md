# Entropy VAD

An implementation of a Permutation Entropy Voice Activity Detector as described
by Xu, Wang, and Bao in "Voice Activity Detection Using Entropy-Based Method",
International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems, 2015.

Code from entropy_vad.py was cut-and-pasted into pe_vad.ipynb to allow for
easy experimentation in a Jupyter notebook. Hopefully, it all stayed in sync.
